# üåâ Bridge Code DAO

> **Revolutionary decentralized governance powered by fully homomorphic encryption**

Bridge Code DAO represents the next evolution in decentralized autonomous organizations, where privacy meets transparency through cutting-edge cryptographic technology. Built for developers, by developers, this platform enables secure, encrypted governance without compromising on transparency.

## üöÄ Core Innovation

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** - The first DAO to implement FHE at scale, allowing computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. Your votes, contributions, and reputation remain private while maintaining full auditability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîê **Zero-Knowledge Governance**: Vote and participate without revealing your choices
- üíé **Encrypted Treasury Management**: Secure fund allocation with privacy-preserving transparency  
- üèóÔ∏è **Decentralized Project Funding**: Support open-source projects with encrypted contribution tracking
- üéØ **Reputation-Based Voting Power**: Meritocratic governance through encrypted reputation systems
- üåê **Multi-Chain Ready**: Built for Ethereum with expansion to other networks planned
- üîó **Seamless Wallet Integration**: Connect with 50+ wallets through RainbowKit

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Vite** for lightning-fast builds and hot module replacement
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent design system

### Web3 Integration
- **Wagmi v2** for Ethereum interaction hooks
- **RainbowKit** for multi-wallet connectivity
- **Viem v2** for low-level blockchain operations
- **Sepolia Testnet** for secure testing environment

### Cryptographic Security
- **FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)** for privacy-preserving computations
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for verifiable private transactions
- **Encrypted State Management** for sensitive data handling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JasonPerry1/bridge-code-dao.git
cd bridge-code-dao
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

4. Update the `.env.local` file with your configuration:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
NEXT_PUBLIC_FHE_NETWORK_URL=YOUR_FHE_NETWORK_URL
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Smart Contract

The DAO is powered by a Solidity smart contract with FHE integration:

- **Project Management**: Create and manage open-source projects
- **Encrypted Voting**: Secure proposal creation and voting
- **Reputation System**: Track member contributions and reputation
- **Treasury Management**: Secure fund management with encrypted balances
